# CPU Scheduling Algorithm 🚀

CPU Scheduling Algorithm is a **frontend web application** designed to visualize and optimize CPU scheduling techniques using various algorithms such as **FCFS, SJF, SRTN, and Round Robin**. The project is built using **HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS** for an interactive scheduling simulation.

## 🌟 Features
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Implements FCFS, SJF (Non-Preemptive), SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next), and Round Robin.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with HTML, JavaScript, and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays **animated Gantt charts** dynamically using D3.js.
- **Fully Frontend-Based**: No backend required; all computations are handled in the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

## 📦 Frontend Dependencies
- **JavaScript** (for algorithm implementation and dynamic UI updates)
- **HTML & Tailwind CSS** (for structure and styling)
